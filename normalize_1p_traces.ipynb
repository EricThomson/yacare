    "# Normalizing outputs of CNMFE\n",
    "You have probably noticed that when you run CNMFE on your 1p data, and try to calculate ∆F/F -- `cnm.estimates.F_dff`, which is generated via `cnm.estimates.detrend_df_f()`-- you will get the following warning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Results should not be interpreted as DF/F normalized but only as detrended.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, while the algorithm is *detrending* the traces, it is not actually generating a *normalized* ∆F/F trace for the components. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is that? It's because the algorithm that caiman uses to normalize the traces with 2p recordings counts on having a well-behaved baseline. This doesn't work for 1p data because the baseline is dominated by out of focus background fluorescence, which makes the problem ill defined (note: I am not 100% sure why it can't be attacked using some iteration of the ring model used in CNMFE, but let's leave that aside for now as caiman doesn't do that).\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot of this is that caiman doesn't generate a normalized signal for your 1p data, but a signal in arbitrary units that makes it hard to compare magnitudes across components. Luckily, there are other powerful techniques you can use to generate a normalization term for your 1p data that will allow for such comparisons. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows one such technique that takes advantage of the spectral noise estimation function from caiman `GetSn()`. The technique was suggested originally by Eftychiios Pnevmatikakis, and is adapted from code written by Zach Berry.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up the imports and building the cnm object (based on the data used in the caiman demo), we will walk through the concepts involved, and then demo some code that shows how to use this technique."

    "It is clear that the spectral method, partly because it limits the signal's bandwidth, ends up putting consistently lower estimates on the noise. When I have played with these methods, for instance by pulling out \"pure noise\" stretches of 1p signals, and calculated the standard deviation on this stretch, the two methods tend to match up fairly closely (though the standard deviation is still typically higher, because the spectral technique is still bandpass-limited). I prefer the spectral technique because by filtering out the stochastic large-amplitude low-frequency fluctuations in the signals, it provides a more consistent estimate of the noise."
