Companion to [CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn) for calcium imaging analysis. There are a lot of questions that tend to come up frequently in [caiman's gitter forum](https://gitter.im/agiovann/Constrained_NMF), and many useful tools embedded in caiman that are not illustrated in the demos. Yacare will address them in standalone Jupyter notebooks with the goal to be relatively explanation-heavy. It mainly assumes you have a working caiman virtual environment.

Yacare is named after the South American [yacare caiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacare_caiman), pictured above.

If you want to contribute, or want to see a topic covered, please open an issue. For caiman support, see the [gitter forum](https://gitter.im/agiovann/Constrained_NMF).
